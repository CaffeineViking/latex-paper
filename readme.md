LaTeX Paper Template
====================

A very simple and minimalistic LaTeX template.

Building and Viewing
--------------------

1. Place yourself in the paper's root directory
2. Just call `make` to build using `pdflatex`
3. You can view with `mupdf` by `make view`
4. Clean up directory: `make distclean`

System Requirements
-------------------

Only tested on `pdflatex`-based distributions.

Structure
---------

* `build`: contains stuff generated by `pdflatex`
* `figures`: should contain all figures for the paper
* `license.md`: don't worry, it's MIT licensed.
* `listings`: should contain all annexed code for paper
* `Makefile`: automatically build the paper on request
* `paper.bib`: bibliography used in the paper
* `paper.pdf`: the generated paper!
* `paper.tex`: imports all packages and styling stuff
* `readme.md`: this file!
* `sections`: each of these files represents a section
    * `*.tex`: each one of these should be a section
